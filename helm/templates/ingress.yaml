# Ingress is very useful when you have multiple apps because it lets you route traffic to different services based on the URL path or domain name (e.g., /app1, /app2, app1.example.com).
# You can also use Ingress for a single app to provide a friendly URL (like myapp.local or myapp.example.com) instead of accessing your app via <node-ip>:<nodePort>.
# Ingress acts as a smart entry point, so you donâ€™t need to expose many NodePorts. Instead, you expose only the Ingress controller (usually on ports 80/443), and it handles routing to your services.
