      <h2>About The Rockers</h2>
      <p>
        Forged in the fires of classic rock and fueled by a passion for loud
        guitars and thunderous drums, The Rockers burst onto the scene in 2015.
        We are [Band Member 1 - Role], [Band Member 2 - Role], [Band Member 3 -
        Role], and [Band Member 4 - Role].
      </p>
      <p>
        Our music is a blend of raw energy, melodic hooks, and lyrics that speak
        to the heart of the rock n roll spirit. Inspired by legends like Led
        Zeppelin, AC/DC, and Guns N' Roses, we strive to create a sound that is
        both timeless and fresh.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, we've played countless gigs, from sweaty club basements
        to festival main stages, sharing our love for rock with fans across the
        globe. Our mission is simple: to play loud, play hard, and keep the
        spirit of rock n roll alive!
      </p>
